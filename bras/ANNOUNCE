I am pleased to announce a new version of bras.

MAJOR CHANGES SINCE THE LAST PUBLISHED VERSION

1) Dependency lists can be generated on the fly. In a rule like
Newer a.o a.c {
  #compile a.c into a.o
}
the name a.c can be understood as a pattern to trigger a script which
computes the true dependency list. In particular the script can run
some kind of makedepend and may even take care of caching the results.

2) The reasoning process can be invoked explicitely. There is no need
to [exec] a child process. This comes in handy in combination with (1)
for the maintenance of said dependency cache.

3) The idea of prerequisites was dropped. Their functionality is now
subsumed by (2).

4) There are no longer system specific rule files. Consequently option
-r is gone. These rule files were never very elaborate. Instead I
started to collect files with generally useful pattern rules which can
be sourced in by a brasfile, if necessary.

5) Previously two different methods were used for
 a) making up a rule for a target without one and
 b) finding a default command for a rule without one.
However, the results tended to be inconsistent. Therefore the concept
was dropped and in case of (b) the target of the partially available
rule is now treated like (a), except that the already available
dependencies are kept. (As far as I found, this is how `make' does
it.) 

6) The docs have a quick-reference appendix.


WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at
   http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/brashome/

From there you can download the distribution, read the docs online or
download the documentation (in PostScript). A list of changes to
previous versions is also available.


WHAT IS IT ANYWAY?

Out of frustration caused by several (mis)features of make I decided
the other day that I would like to have a tool which combines 
rule-based and script-like command execution. The result is bras. It
is written in Tcl and the rule-files it uses are also pretty much
Tcl. However, bras defines a set of new Tcl-commands which implement
rule-based command execution.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o more than one type of rule: Newer, Exist, Always;
o new types of rules can be easily added;
o multiple targets in one rule;
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
o explicit invocation of the reasoning process possible;
o automagically created dependency lists
