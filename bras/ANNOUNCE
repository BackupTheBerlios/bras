		     Rule Base Command Execution
			       with Tcl

I am pleased to announce a new version of bras. 

MAJOR CHANGES SINCE THE LAST PUBLISHED VERSION

o Dependencies are now searched in a list of directories. This eases
the definition built-environments where source directories are
read-only and/or source files may come from generic or platform
specific directories.

o Options to control the output during operation have changed: -ve
shows external commands, -v shows the full tcl-command list to be
executed, -s even supresses the printing of targets to be made. The
terse output produced by default is probably the most visible change
for a user.

o The whole operation was changed. Instead of first performing the
full reasoning and merely collecting commands to be executed, commands
are now executed as soon as they are found. This has two consequences:

  a) Option -d can no longer work without executing any
  command. Instead it produces debugging output along with normal
  operations.

  b) The semantic of the Newer-rule has changed slightly. Bras no
  longer assumes that a dependency is in fact updated if its
  associated command is executed. Instead it always checks
  modification times. As a result, commands of pattern rules which
  produce more than one file will not be triggered more than once.

o Exist- and Always-rules may no longer have dependencies. Only
prerequisites are allowed. Similarly Newer- and DependsFile-rules
don't understand their dependencies also as prerequisites by default.



WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at
   http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/brashome/

From there you can download the distribution, read the docs online or
download the documentation (in PostScript). A list of changes to
previous versions is also available.



WHAT IS THAT BRAS ANYWAY?

Out of frustration caused by several (mis)features of make I decided
the other day that I would like to have a tool which combines 
rule-based and script-like command execution. The result is bras. It
is written in Tcl and the rule-files it uses are also pretty much
Tcl. However, bras defines a set of new Tcl-commands which implement
rule-based command execution.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o more than one type of rule: Newer, Exist, Always, DependsFile;
o new types of rules can be easily added;
o distinction between dependencies and mere prerequisites;
o multiple targets in one rule;
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
