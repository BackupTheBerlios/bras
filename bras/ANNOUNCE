		     Rule Based Command Execution

I am pleased to announce version 2.1.

WHAT'S NEW?

A new predicate md5older was introduced. It checks if a target is out
of by considering only the md5sums of the dependencies.

Recently (2.0) individiual namespaces for every directory where
introduced. The implementation of the mechanism was buggy and had
to be rewritten.


STABILITY:

The new namespace encapsulation is still not fully tested. I am not
yet sure if it really helps on multi-directory projects or if it
rather is in the way. Let me know.


WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at

WHAT IS IT ANYWAY?

Out of frustration caused by several (mis)features of make I decided
the other day that I would like to have a tool which combines 
rule-based and script-like command execution. The result is bras. It
is written in Tcl and the rule-files it uses are also pretty much
Tcl. However, bras defines a set of new Tcl-commands which implement
rule-based command execution.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o just any boolean expression can be used to define when a target is
  out-of-date. 
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
o explicit invocation of the reasoning process possible;
