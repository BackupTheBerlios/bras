		     Rule Based Command Execution
			       with Tcl

I am pleased to announce version 1.4.0. 

WHAT'S NEW?

To make it easier to use bras, the driver script no longer relies on
the package to be installed. That means you just copy one file around
to get a runnable bras. This allows you to use bras in your projects
without relying on it to be installed on every machine you move
to. Just copy that 64k script along with your project. All that is
needed on a target machine is a Tcl of at least version 8.0.

Of course bras, the package, can still be used as before.


WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at
   http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/brashome/

From there you can download the distribution, read the docs online or
download the documentation (in PostScript). A list of changes to
previous versions is also available.


WHAT IS IT ANYWAY?

Out of frustration caused by several (mis)features of make I decided
the other day that I would like to have a tool which combines 
rule-based and script-like command execution. The result is bras. It
is written in Tcl and the rule-files it uses are also pretty much
Tcl. However, bras defines a set of new Tcl-commands which implement
rule-based command execution.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o just any boolean expression can be used to define when a target is
  out-of-date. 
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
o explicit invocation of the reasoning process possible;
