Hi there,

today I would like to announce a new version of bras (another kind of
`make').

The home page is at http://www.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/Bras/brasHome.html

It is for all those of you who know the value of `make' and who are at
the same time not totally happy with it for one reason or another.

Main features of bras are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o totally written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax, so if you like Tcl, you will like bras;
o dependencies in foreign directories are handled nicely;
o more than one type of rule;
o new types of rules can be easily added;
o distinction between dependencies and mere prerequisites;
o multiple targets in one rule;
o multiple rules for a target;
o pattern rules which deserve the name;


I consider this alpha software, so be prepared.

Try it and tell me what you think.

	Harald Kirsch
