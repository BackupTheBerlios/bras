		     Rule Based Command Execution
			       with Tcl

I am pleased to announce version 1.0.0. 
If you don't know bras: go to the end of this message for more info.

Finally the step to 1.0.0 had to be done. No major changes happend
recently. In fact this is more or less a bugfix release against the
last published version.


MAJOR CHANGES SINCE 0.99.5

-- The predicate [varchanged] is should be really useful and working
now. 
-- Option -ve was broken and now works again.
-- The predicate [oldcache] had some problems when one of its
arguments did not exist as a file.]
-- Added two examples. One shows predicate [varchanged] at work, the
other demonstrates how an new predicate can be written.
-- Error handling was thought over again. If a bug in Bras causes an
exception, this should no longer be obscured.
-- When executing predicates or commands, bras guards again a
directory change even in case of exceptions.

INCOMPATIBILITY:
-- Executed commands have their error output no longer redirected to
the stderr. Instead, if they print something on stderr, bras
interpretes this as an error similar to a non-zero exit code.


WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at
   http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/brashome/

From there you can download the distribution, read the docs online or
download the documentation (in PostScript). A list of changes to
previous versions is also available.


WHAT IS IT ANYWAY?

Out of frustration caused by several (mis)features of make I decided
the other day that I would like to have a tool which combines 
rule-based and script-like command execution. The result is bras. It
is written in Tcl and the rule-files it uses are also pretty much
Tcl. However, bras defines a set of new Tcl-commands which implement
rule-based command execution.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o just any boolean expression can be used to define when a target is
  out-of-date. 
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
o explicit invocation of the reasoning process possible;
