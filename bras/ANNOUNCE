		     Rule Base Command Execution
			       with Tcl

I am pleased to announce a new version of bras. 

MAJOR CHANGES SINCE THE LAST PUBLISHED VERSION

o A new type of rule called DependsFile handles the dependency between
  an object file and its associated source file. It takes included
  files into account.
o The semantics of pattern rules changed and was greatly enhanced.



(This announcement was due a month ago, but seems to have been lost
during the change of moderator. To bad it took me so long to find the
time to write an announcement again.)


The distribution  can be found at
   http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/brashome/

From there you can download the distribution, read the docs online or
download the documentation (in PostScript). A list of changes to
previous versions is also available.



WHAT IS THAT BRAS ANYWAY?

Out of frustration caused by several (mis)features of make I decided
the other day that I would like to have a tool which combines 
rule-based and script-like command execution. The result is bras. It
is written in Tcl and the rule-files it uses are also pretty much
Tcl. However, bras defines a set of new Tcl-commands which implement
rule-based command execution.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o more than one type of rule: Newer, Exist, Always, DependsFile;
o new types of rules can be easily added;
o distinction between dependencies and mere prerequisites;
o multiple targets in one rule;
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
