		     Rule Based Command Execution
			       with Tcl

I am pleased to announce version 0.99.5 of bras. This is supposed to
be a beta version in preparation of 1.0.0.

If you don't know bras: go to the end of this message for more info.



MAJOR CHANGES SINCE 0.99.4

Mainly the support for bras as a package used in Tk-applications was
improved. This includes:
-- [forget] tells bras to forget about targets it considered already
thereby enabling it to start the reasoning again after the user
changed some settings.
-- All console output is produced by one proc which can be easily
redefined to send output e.g. into a widget.
-- The package contains no longer any calls to [exit]. Instead fatal
errors throw an exception.
-- New predicate [varchanged] returns true, if the value of a given
variable changed since the last call to this predicate.
-- All this is documented.

WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at

From there you can download the distribution, read the docs online or
download the documentation (in PostScript). A list of changes to
previous versions is also available.


WHAT IS IT ANYWAY?

Out of frustration caused by several (mis)features of make I decided
the other day that I would like to have a tool which combines 
rule-based and script-like command execution. The result is bras. It
is written in Tcl and the rule-files it uses are also pretty much
Tcl. However, bras defines a set of new Tcl-commands which implement
rule-based command execution.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o just any boolean expression can be used to define when a target is
  out-of-date. 
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
o explicit invocation of the reasoning process possible;
