		     Rule Based Command Execution

I am pleased to announce version 2.2.

WHAT'S NEW?

The error reporting was redesigned and reimplemented due to buggy
behaviour in some circumstances.

A new rule was added to the default rule set. It translates .lex to .c. 



WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at

WHAT IS IT ANYWAY?

Bras is a rules-based command execution system, ala 'make'. It
includes a powerful rules system supporting foreign directory
triggers, multiple rule types, and on-the-fly dependency
generation. It is written in Tcl and uses Tcl as its script language.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o just any boolean expression can be used to define when a target is
  out-of-date;
o pattern rules which allow to derive dependencies and/or commands on
  the fly;
o explicit invocation of the reasoning process possible;
o reasoning engine can be used as a module in Tcl programs;
