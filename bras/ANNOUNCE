		     Rule Based Command Execution
			       with Tcl

I am pleased to announce version 1.3.0. 

What's new?

A pattern rule was added which eases installation of files. A file
specification like /usr/bin/bla/0755 automatically creates a
dependency relation between /usr/bin/bla and ./bla. If the latter file
is newer, it is copied over /usr/bin/bla and has the permissions set
as requested, i.e. 0755 in this example.

The docs were updated and an example is also available.


WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at
   http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/brashome/

From there you can download the distribution, read the docs online or
download the documentation (in PostScript). A list of changes to
previous versions is also available.


WHAT IS IT ANYWAY?

Out of frustration caused by several (mis)features of make I decided
the other day that I would like to have a tool which combines 
rule-based and script-like command execution. The result is bras. It
is written in Tcl and the rule-files it uses are also pretty much
Tcl. However, bras defines a set of new Tcl-commands which implement
rule-based command execution.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o just any boolean expression can be used to define when a target is
  out-of-date. 
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
o explicit invocation of the reasoning process possible;
