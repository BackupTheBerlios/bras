Although it is one of the best tools around,
sometimes I find working with <TT>make</TT> a bit annoying, and I
assume everbody knows his or her most disliked misfeatures of
<TT>make</TT>, so I will not repeat them here.
<p>

If you know the talking, you can immediately download
<A HREF="ftp://www.iitb.fhg.de/pub/kir/bras.tar.gz">
bras.tar.gz (~100k)
</A>,
read the
<A HREF="onlinedoc/Bras.html">online
documentation</A>
or download the
<A HREF="Bras.ps">documentation</A> alone.
<p>

Otherwise you may want to have a look at the <B>main features</B>
first.
<blockquote><em>REMARK: Some of the features mentioned below are not yet
available in the version you can download. They are however already 
implemented. I am testing the new release and updating the docs.
</em></blockquote>
<UL>
<li> rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
<LI> totally written in Tcl, no compilation required;
<li> Tcl-syntax, so if you like Tcl, you will like bras;
<li> dependencies in foreign directories are handled nicely;<br>

<blockquote>
If a dependency starts with <TT>@</TT> and contains a pathname, the
rule file of this directory is automatically read, assuming that it
contains the rules for making the dependency. In particular, no
recursive call of bras is necessary, i.e. the chain of reasoning is
not broken.
</blockquote>

<li> more than one type of rule;
<blockquote>
A reason for making a target is usually that it is older than its
dependencies. However bras has several types of rules implementing
other reasons. The <TT>Exist</TT>-rule fires only, if the target does
not exist. The <TT>Always</TT>-rule fires always.
</blockquote>

<li> new types of rules can be easily added;
<blockquote>
If the standard-types of rules are not enough, bras allows to define
new types of rules. Maybe you need a rule that makes its target if it
is <EM>smaller</EM> than a dependency.
</blockquote>

<li> clear distinction between dependencies and mere prerequisites;
<blockquote>
Sometimes the command to update a target needs additional files beside
the dependencies which have otherwise nothing to do with the
target. In particular, they should not cause the rule to fire. Those
files can be clearly differentiated from the dependencies.
</blockquote>

<li> multiple targets in one rule;
<blockquote> 
This is typically necessary, if a command creates more
than one file.
</blockquote>

<li> multiple rules for a target;
<blockquote>
If one rule fails because a dependency cannot be made, maybe the next
one works.
</blockquote>

<li> pattern rules which deserve the name;
<blockquote>
The target of a pattern rule is a regular expression. To derive the
dependency in case the target matches, any Tcl-proc can be called.
</blockquote>
</UL>

Bras is new and therefore not yet fully developed. Features
which are currently missing are:
<ul>
<li>parallel execution of commands (like gnu make's -j option);
<li>automatic conversion of makefiles;
<li>private variable scope for rule-files in different directories;
<li>application of pattern rules in a way which allows to bridge
several missing links; 
</ul>
