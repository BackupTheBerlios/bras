## Pattern rules are set up to create the following build-chain:
## A* --> B* --> C*

proc GenDepC {target} {
  return C[string range $target 1 end]
}
PatternNewer B.* C {
  puts "making $trigger -> $target"
}


proc GenDepB {target} {
  return B[string range $target 1 end]
}
PatternNewer A.* B {
  puts "making $trigger -> $target"
}




## Now request to make a file starting with A
Always all Axxxx {
  puts done
}

## Terminate the chaining with an existing rule
Exist Cxxxx {} {
  puts "making Cxxxx"
}
