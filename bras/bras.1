.SH NAME
bras -\ utility for rule base command execution

.SH SYNOPSIS
bras [-d] [-f brasfile] [-h] [-n] [-r] [-v] [target] ...

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -d
show reasoning, don't execute any commands. This option requests a
detailed description of the reasoning performed by bras and is useful
for debugging.

.IP "-f brasfile"
specifies the rule-file to use.
Defaults are 
.I brasfile
and
.I Brasfile
in that order.

.IP -h
show usage message and exit.

.IP -n
don't execute external commands. External commands are those which are
not built into Tcl, like rm, cat, cp and the like.

.IP -r
don't read system's standard rule files. Standard rule files are
.RI |SRCBASE|/rules. system ,
where
.I system
is the result of a call to 
.IR "uname -s" .

.IP -v
show all command lists (not only external commands). Usually only
external commands are listed before they are executed. With
.I -v
the whole command list is listed before it is executed.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The utility 
.I bras
is written in Tcl and is inteded to be used similar to the (in)famous
.I make
utility. A rule file, usually called
.I brasfile
contains rules describing when and how certain commands should be
executed to bring a 
.I target
up-to-date. 
.I Bras
reads the file given with option 
.I  -f
or either
.IR brasfile " or " Brasfile .
Using the rules found in the file,
.I bras 
hen determines the commands which are necessary to bring the target(s)
listed on the command line up-to-date. If no target was given, the
target of the first rule found in the file is considered.

Depending on the options used, 
.I bras
executes the derived command list with different levels of verbosity,
shows its reasoning or merely shows what it would do.
