o Update doc
  (This probably never goes away)

o BUG: defaultCmd considers pattern rules in the order in which they
were entered. This way it is not possible to override a "standard"
pattern rule with you own one. (Check doc regarding this.)
(Corrected 1997-11-08).

o Do I have the same problem for pattern rules?

o BUG: SuffixNewer is mentioned in the html-files. (Should be
Pattern...)

o Find out how to give every brasfile its own scope so that a variable
  like SRC is not messed up, if it is used in several brasfiles.

o Parallel execution (like make's -j)

o Option to switch between the following modes:
  a) Collect *all* commands first, then start executing
  b) Start executing as soon as a command shows up. 
     - Might be complicated in connection with targets which cannot be
     made with their first rule.   
     - Might conflict with option -d
