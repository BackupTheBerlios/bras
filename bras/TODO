o Update doc
  (This probably never goes away)

o Find out how to give every brasfile its own scope so that a variable
  like SRC is not messed up, if it is used in several brasfiles.

o Parallel execution (like make's -j)

o Option to switch between the following modes:
  a) Collect *all* commands first, then start executing
  b) Start executing as soon as a command shows up. 
     - Might be complicated in connection with targets which cannot be
     made with their first rule.   
     - Might conflict with option -d
