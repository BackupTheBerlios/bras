o Update doc
  (This probably never goes away)


o Find out how to give every brasfile its own scope so that a variable
  like SRC is not messed up, if it is used in several brasfiles.

o Parallel execution (like make's -j)

o Option to switch between the following modes:
  a) Collect *all* commands first, then start executing
  b) Start executing as soon as a command shows up. 
     - Might be complicated in connection with targets which cannot be
     made with their first rule.   
     - Might conflict with option -d

o A check to test if there is a rule for a target.

o Catch all-rules as pattern-rules
>- This doesn't work either:
>PatternNewer (.*\.a} {} {echo a}
>
>The idea would be a match anything rule for building libraries.. 


o Selective rule dumping for debugging purposes.

o Silent operation, very silent operation.

o More intelligent abseiling along a chain of pattern rule so that
there is no need for intermediate targets to exist.


This is done already (read from bottom to top):
===============================================
o Do I have the same problem for pattern rules?
(Yes, corrected 1997-11-09)


o BUG: defaultCmd considers pattern rules in the order in which they
were entered. This way it is not possible to override a "standard"
pattern rule with you own one. (Check doc regarding this.)
(Corrected 1997-11-08).

o BUG: SuffixNewer is mentioned in the html-files. (Should be
Pattern...)
(Corrected 1997-11-08).
