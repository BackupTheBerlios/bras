PREREQUISITES

If you don't have tcl, you are out of luck. Until now, I tested it
with tcl7.6, but it probably works with other versions.

The whole installation script is probably less portable than the
program it installs. Therefore, if the installation script fails, you
can do it the stone-age way:

o copy bras, all .tcl-files and all rules.*-files to the installation
  directory  
o edit bras so that it finds
  - tclsh
  - the other files you just copied around.
  This is achieved by entering the path to tclsh in the first line of
  bras and replacing |SRCBASE| in the second line with the absolute
  path of the installation directory.



HOW TO INSTALL

o read README
o run `install.wish'

				That easy?
					I hope so!
