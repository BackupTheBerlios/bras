PREREQUISITES

If you don't have tcl, you are out of luck. You need a Tcl version
with namespace support, i.e. >= 8.0 .

INSTALLATION

Run the command

  tclsh bras prefix=/directory/where/to/install

to install bras. This will install bras' files in the following
directories: 

   $prefix/bin
   $prefix/lib/bras-$VERSION
   $prefix/doc/bras-$VERSION
   $prefix/man/man1

Read the top of `brasfile' to see how to individually change these
directories. 

				That easy?
					I hope so!

P.S.: The script `dotest' is currently broken. Don't try it out.
