<H1>bras --- Rule Based Command Execution</H1>

Executing commands according to rules instead of in the order in which
they appear is the great idea which gave us famous
<code>make</code>. 
<p>

Although I am quite happy with <code>make</code> most of the time, it has
some rough edges which I really dislike. There fore I decided the
other day that I want to have my own little tool without the rough
edges. The result is <code>bras</code>.  <p>

Its main features are:
<ul>
<li>rule-controlled command execution, similar to <code>make</code>;
<li>written in Tcl, no compilation required;
<li>Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
<li>dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive execution of <code>bras</code> is not
necessary; 
<li>more than one type of rule: Newer, Exist, Always;
<li>new types of rules can be easily added;
<li>distinction between dependencies and mere prerequisites;
<li>multiple targets in one rule;
<li>multiple rules for a target;
<li>pattern rules which deserve the name;
</ul>

Of course not all of those are unique to <code>bras</code> compared to
<code>make</code>. My favorites are Tcl-syntax and the ability to reason
over several directories without the necessity to execute <code>bras</code>
recursively. You may want to study a trivial 
<A HREF="brasfile.exa">example</A> 
to find out if <code>bras</code> is for you.
<p>


You can now download the 
<a href="ftp:bras.ps.gz">gzipped PostScript documentation</a> or
the latest release <a href="ftp:|BRASTARGZ|">|BRASTARGZ|</a>, which
includes the documentation.
<p>

For a start you can also read the <a href="manual/bras.html">online
documentation</a>. If you know <code>bras</code> already, you may be
interested in the <a href="CHANGES">changes</a> since the last
release.

Please send comments and suggestions to 
<a href="mailto:kir@iitb.fhg.de">Harald Kirsch</a>. Flames expressing
the opinion that <code>bras</code> is heresy against holy <code>make</code> are
redirected to <code>/dev/null</code>.
