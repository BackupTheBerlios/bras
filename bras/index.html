<H1>bras --- Rule Based Command Execution</H1>

<p>Executing commands according to rules instead of in the order in which
they appear is the great idea which gave us famous
<code>make</code>. 


<p>Although I am quite happy with <code>make</code> most of the time,
it has some rough edges which I really dislike. Therefore I decided
the other day that I want to have my own little tool without the rough
edges. The result is <code>bras</code>.

<p>Its main features are:
<ul>
<li>rule-controlled command execution, similar to <code>make</code>;
<li>written in Tcl, no compilation required;
<li>Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
<li>dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive execution of <code>bras</code> is not
necessary; 
<li>any type of test can render a target out-of-date
<li>pattern rules which deserve the name;
</ul>

<p>Of course not all of those are unique to <code>bras</code> compared
to <code>make</code>. My favorites are Tcl-syntax and the ability to
reason over several directories without the necessity to execute
<code>bras</code> recursively. But even better is the possibility to
      describe when a target is out of date by just any boolean
      expression which can be written down with Tcl-code.

 <p>The current version is |VERSION|. You may want to read the
      list of recent <a href="CHANGES">CHANGES</a>. The software
      including full documentation
      <font color="red">can be downloaded from</font>

<!--
<p>You may want to study a trivial <A HREF="brasfile.exa">example</A>
to find out if <code>bras</code> is for you.

<p>You can download the <a href="./bras.ps.gz">gzipped PostScript
documentation</a>, the latest release as <a
href="./|BRASTARGZ|">|BRASTARGZ|</a>, or as <a
href="./|BRASRPM|">|BRASRPM|</a> both of which include the
documentation. Since <code>bras</code> does not contain any binary
files, the rpm might also work on non-intel platforms.

<p>For a start you can also read the documentation as a <a
href="bras.pdf">PDF-file</a> as. If you know <code>bras</code>
already, you may be interested in the <a href="CHANGES">changes</a>
since the last release.

<p>All versions of bras are <a href="dir.ttml">available</a>.
