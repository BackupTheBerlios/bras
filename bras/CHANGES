***** 0.0.2 (1997-03-11)
bras.buildCmds: If the target was done already, the `cd $keepPWD' was a bit
early, which resulted in a variable not existing.

The install-script did not enter the path to the installation correctly
into bras.

Simple rule file for SunOS added.

***** 0.0.1 (1997-03-04)
First version with a real version number. Older ones were only identified by
date.

install.wish now allows to specify the tclsh-executable.

Very simple test suite added.

***** old history
o Since tcl7.4, auto_execok seems to have changed its return value. This
  led to a change in evalCmds, proc bras.unknown.

o When exec'ing external commands in bras.unknown, stderr was redirected
  to stdout. This had bad effects when the command itself did redirection.

A wrong tcl-version in the install script no longer exits the script. It only
results in a warning.

o Corrected bug where a target was not rebuild, if one of its 
  dependencies was rebuild for another target.

Started writing doc. Revealed a misconception about Exist-Rules which let
to the decision to also let Exist-Rules have dependencies. Implemented that,
but did not yet test it. The program might even not run through.
